# **Smart Vision Quality Control System**

This project was developed as part of the **FLIPKART GRID 6.0** competition, where the objective was to design a smart vision system to automate quality and quantity checks in the e-commerce industry using advanced camera vision technology.

## **Purpose**
The system automates the inspection of products during shipment, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in quality control processes.

## **Solution Overview**
My solution includes four critical use cases to address common quality control needs:

- **OCR-based Detail Extraction**: Extracts key details such as product name, packaging information, and serial numbers from images.
- **Expiry Date Validation**: Uses OCR to recognize and validate the expiration dates of perishable products, ensuring only fresh items are shipped.
- **Brand Recognition and Count Confirmation**: Identifies the product brand and confirms the count using image recognition and machine learning models.
- **Freshness Detection**: Analyzes visual characteristics such as color and texture to assess the freshness of perishable goods like fruits and vegetables.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Computer Vision**: For image acquisition and preprocessing
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: To extract text data like product details and expiration dates
- **Machine Learning**: For brand recognition and freshness detection
- **Python**: Main programming language used for model implementation

## **Features**
- Real-time product identification and quality verification
- Automated expiration date validation
- Brand and quantity verification to ensure order accuracy
- Freshness detection for perishable items

## **Future Recommendations**
- Improve adaptability to different lighting conditions and product types
- Expand support for more complex product categories and packaging types
- Integrate advanced machine learning techniques to further enhance system accuracy
